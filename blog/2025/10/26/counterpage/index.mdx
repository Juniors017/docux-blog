After adding GoatCounter to my blog, my goal was to test the following:
- Display the number of views for a page.
- In the article list, show the views for each post individually.
- Avoid HTML injection and the “flash” of unparsed content (common when using JavaScript or the iframe).

Official GoatCounter docs for this: [View counts](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/visitor-counter)
	{/* truncate */}
## Why use the JSON API instead of `visit_count()`?

- Inline `<script>` tags aren’t well supported by MDX/Docusaurus (acorn parsing errors).
- `visit_count()` injects raw HTML, which causes a visible “flash” before we can parse/format it. <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/vuegoatcounteriframe.webp" altText="Flash" buttonName="here's what flashes for 1–3 seconds"  />
- The JSON API only returns data (no HTML). We keep full control of the rendering: icon, localized formatting, accessibility, etc.

**Conclusion:** Using JSON avoids third‑party HTML injection, removes the flash, and keeps the rendering fully under your control.



## Load GoatCounter globally

Learn more here: [Goatcounter Analytics](/blog/goatcounter/)

```js "title="docusaurus.config.js"
///...existing config...
scripts: [
	{
		src: 'https://gc.zgo.at/count.js',
		async: true,
		'data-goatcounter': 'https://yourName.goatcounter.com/count',
		crossOrigin: 'anonymous',
	},
],
```


This script records visits. The JSON API is only used to read/display them.

## React component: JSON fetch + accessible rendering

### The component
- Detects the base `https://yourName.goatcounter.com` from the `data-goatcounter` attribute injected into the page;
- Determines the target path (prop `path` takes precedence, otherwise it uses the current path);
- Calls `/counter/<path>.json` and formats according to `navigator.language`;
- Renders an “eyes” icon (twemoji) + the number, with `aria-label="views"`.

### Logic
On errors or blockers:
- Display rule: if total views < 100 → show “New!”, otherwise show the formatted number (useful for young blogs).
- If the JSON endpoint returns 404 (page never seen by GoatCounter in prod), also show “New!”.
- On `localhost`, GoatCounter doesn’t count, but will display whatever is already stored.
- On network/ad‑blocker errors (JSON request fails), the fallback shows 0 in dev and nothing in prod; if the return is `null` we render nothing.

The 100‑views rule can be adjusted to your needs. After a chat with a Belgian meerkat, it’s true that showing low view counts can be perceived as a negative signal when the numbers are relatively small.

## Usage in an MDX page

### In a standard post

```mdx
---
title: "View counter"
---

Seen by: <GoatCounterViews />  meerkats
```

The component will display the views for the current page.

Seen by: 2600 meerkats

## Post list

### On a listing page (e.g., Blog)

If you display *multiple* posts, you must request the counter for **each post** by passing its exact path. For example, in a swizzled component (header of a blog post item):

Provide the path `path={metadata.permalink}` for each post
```jsx "title="src/theme/BlogPostItem/Header/index.js"
import GoatCounterViews from '@site/src/components/GoatCountViews';

export default function BlogPostItemHeader({metadata, ...props}) {
	return (
		<>
			{/* ...existing code... */}
			<GoatCounterViews path={metadata.permalink} />
		</>
	);
}
```

**This way, each card shows the views of its own article, not the views of the listing page.**
