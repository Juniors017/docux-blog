The default 404 page in Docusaurus is functional, but quite basic. For many years now, it has become a page that allows you to stand out even though it's the result of a website flaw (broken link or unredirected URL).
Building a stylish 404 page is therefore an opportunity to provide a better experience when a link breaks. Here's how I set up a custom 404 with Docusaurus, keeping the page lightweight and responsive.

## Objectives for the custom 404 page

- Full screen with a dedicated background image
- Simple, readable, centered text
- Optimized mobile version (image and adapted viewport units)
- Minimal implementation via Docusaurus swizzle mechanism

I could have added home or search buttons, but I wanted to keep the page very lightweight.

## Swizzle the NotFound/Content component

Docusaurus exposes a 404 view via `@theme/NotFound`. I swizzled its `Content` part to customize the rendering.

### Command
<Terminal title="user@machine: ~/yourproject">

npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic NotFound --eject

</Terminal>

- `@docusaurus/theme-classic` → the theme you want to modify (default for most sites).

- `NotFound` → the 404 page component.

- `--eject` → creates a real local copy of the component you can edit.

This creates the override in `src/theme/NotFound/Content/`.

## The React component

We just created what will allow us to customize the 404 page rendering.

### Basic file

<Snippet filename="src/theme/NotFound/Content/index.js" >

```js title="src/theme/NotFound/Content/index.js"
import React from 'react';
import Content from '@theme-original/NotFound/Content';

export default function ContentWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <Content {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```
</Snippet>

### Custom file

<Snippet filename="src/theme/NotFound/Content/index.js" source="src/theme/NotFound/Content/index.js"/>   


Note: I keep an `<h1>` for semantics and accessibility, but I hide it visually with CSS since the image meets my needs.

## Full screen, responsive and lightweight styling

<Snippet filename="src/theme/NotFound/Content/styles.module.css" source="src/theme/NotFound/Content/styles.module.css"/>   

### Key points:

- Optimized WebP images: `static/img/404bg.webp` (desktop) and `static/img/404mobile.webp` (mobile) *to learn more about image optimization [See Cavo789's tutorial](https://www.avonture.be/blog/reduce-image-size)*
- Modern viewport units: `dvh`/`svh` handle URL bars/mobile bounds better than `vh`
- `background-attachment: scroll` on mobile to avoid stuttering and improve iOS compatibility (yes I love apples)
- Adaptive typography via `clamp()` to stay readable on small screens

## Add the assets

Place your images in `static/img/` so they're served from the site root. Naming is up to you, but here are mine:

- `/img/404bg.webp`
- `/img/404mobile.webp`

You can generate two versions (desktop/mobile) to reduce the weight transferred on mobile and have a cleaner rendering.

## Quick testing

For quick testing use this command

<Terminal title="user@machine: ~/yourproject">

npm start

</Terminal>

In development, launch the site and visit a non-existent URL (for example `/url-that-does-not-exist`). You should see the full-screen background and the centered message.

## This is just the beginning

### Some ideas to go further:

- Add a "Back to home" or "Search" button
- Instrument an analytics event to know how often the 404 is viewed
- Adapt the illustration in dark mode (if you force a light/dark image)
- Add light CSS animations to make the page more dynamic
- Add a more personalized error message (for example, based on the URL)
- Indicate useful links (FAQ, support, etc.)
- Record the initial request



In the end, swizzling only `NotFound/Content` is enough to create a custom, expressive and performant 404, while staying aligned with Docusaurus theme architecture.
